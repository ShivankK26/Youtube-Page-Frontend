In this Project, I've built the FrontEnd Page for YouTube. All the buttons, search bar and tabs have been included in it.


Use the `README.md` to get started.

To get started, first of all create both the HTML and CSS files and then using HTML create a raw design for the web page which would be later on styled using CSS. All the buttons which are available on YouTube are also available on this web page.
